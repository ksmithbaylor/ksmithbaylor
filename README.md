# Hey there!

I'm Kevin. I live about an hour outside of Atlanta with my wife and three kids
and write software for a living. When I'm not spending time with my family, I
like to build things. Sometimes that means a small tool that's useful to me, or
a more ambitious product that can be more broadly useful to others. But no
matter what I'm building, I try to stretch myself to learn new skills and look
at problems differently.

At the end of 2019, my wife and I both finished our master's degrees. We're
incredibly thankful to have more of our time back, and I'm looking forward to
having more free time to pursue hobbies and side projects! Most of the work I do
gets shared here, and I'm excited for what's ahead.

If something I've built is useful to you, feel free to
