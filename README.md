# Hey there!

I'm Kevin. I live in rural north Georgia with my wife and four kids
and write software for a living. When I'm not spending time with my family, I
like to build things. Sometimes that means a small tool that's useful to me, or
a more ambitious product that can be more broadly useful to others. But no
matter what I'm building, I try to stretch myself to learn new skills and look
at problems differently.

If something I've built is useful to you, feel free to
[buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/ksmithbaylor) or [send me some
crypto](https://commerce.coinbase.com/checkout/1b1ddff5-7176-414c-b4e0-a9b6832ac9b0)!
